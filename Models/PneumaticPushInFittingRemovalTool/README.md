## Pneumatic Push-in Fitting Removal Tool

This is a tool for removing the standard push-in fittings from pneumatic equipment. Made for both 4mm and 6mm tubes. I couldn't find any already-made tool models for this job, so I thought I will make my own.

This is my first time using Blender for actual modelling, so this will most likely have a few flaws at the start. Please let me know if you find any.

## Versions

**Note that the times are with 100% infill and 0.12 resolution. Supports are also used while getting the times.**

I have made several versions of the item, but only uploaded the ones that have bigger changes. I will give a quick summary on which one you need for what job:

- v5: It's the economical and quick option, and the one that you can print in the least time with the most number possible on one plate. It's pretty durable still, but a bit uncomfortable to use. I would recommend it if you need to print them en masse. It takes about 6-8 mins to print this one.

- v10: The standard one, and the most universal one as well. Both sockets can be used for 3mm, so if one breaks you can still use the other one as the redundant one until you can print another one. Breaks less than v5, but takes longer to print by about 10-15 minutes. This is the one you should choose if you need one that prints reasonably fast, and offers the least tradeoffs. It's pretty comfortable to use as well, and can still be mass-printed, but they take up more space than the v5.

- v13: The newest model, made with reliability in mind. Note that it's no longer fully universal for the sockets, but both can still be used with 3mm if you push the tube into the 6mm socket a bit more. Has an agressive handle pattern, so it's a lot more comfortable than the other models, and can also be used better in tight spaces. The sockets were made to look a bit better as well, and they no longer require supports to work, though they are still recommended.Takes about 35-40 mins to print, so it's not perfect for mass-printing.

- v14: Designed like a crowbar for when you wanna do it Gordon Freeman style. Thus it has the best reach, and can even reach into really tight spaces without any problem. It's a bit less comfortable than v13, but if you need reach this is the one you should choose.
TL;DR:  If you value cost and time and don't care about comfortability that much, go for v5. If you need an all-rounder that can take a beating, go for the v10 unless you have more time, in that case go for the v13.

## Modifying it in Blender
!! The next section of the description is for modifying the model, so don't worry about it if you're only using the supplied STL files !!

I also supply a Blender file where you can modify any properties of the item, along with a few stuff you can do with it.

Enabling the keychain hole: There is a hole on the middle of the tool for mounting it on a keychain. I have two different STLs uploaded, one the keychain hole and the other without it. If you want to enable the keychain in Blender, just select the tool body and go into the modifier properties on the bottom right side. There will be an unapplied boolean modifier there that you can apply for the hole to be cut. After that's done, you can just delete the cylinder above the tool, as it's not needed anymore. I could make a more elegant solution, but it's good enough for me for now. If you don't need the keychain, just delete the cylinder and you're done.

I will write more about the making process and stuff like that later, but those will have to come later.
