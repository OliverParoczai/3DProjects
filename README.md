# 3DProjects
This is the place where I will upload my 3D printer config (Ender 5), and the models I made.

Everything I make is under the [Creative Commons - Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and I will include the OpenSCAD file/other editable project files with the model, along with a description for each.

## Printer
I use an Ender 5 printer as my daily driver, but I also have a Prusa i3 MK3S as my secondary. I will only detail the Ender 5, as my Prusa is close to stock.

### Ender 5

- **Mainboard & Display**: Replaced with the _BIGTREETECH SKR E3 DIP_, and _BIGTREETECH TFT35-E3 V3.0_. The modifications required for getting it to work with the Ender 5 have been added to the Ender5/E3/ folder. I would recommend buying the DIP version of the mainboard, as it can be upgraded later for a lot cheaper, but you will need to remove the secondary fan from the housing for it to be able to fit, but it isn't needed as the mainboard has passive cooling. For the display the only thing that needs to be done for it to work is updating it's firmware. This update has made the printer almost completely silent, while also boosting the precision of the motors.
- **Cabling**: I have installed cable chains, to reduce the footprint of the printer. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3967562) on how to do it. It also improves the looks of the printer, which is always a bonus.
- **Extruder**: I just upgraded it with the metal extruder kit, and replaced the tubing with Capricorn tubes. They wear out a lot slower than the stock tubing, doesn't slip out of the fitting, and looks better. I would recommend upgrading to a Direct-Drive extruder though, as it reduces the footprint even more.
- **Power Supply**: Replaced with a _Meanwell LRS-350-24V_, as the stock one has some known problems. I still use the stock PSU as a bench supply, but I wouldn't use it for anything more taxing.
- **Bed Springs**: I recommend replacing the stock ones with _10mm OD 25mm length_ ones, preferably in blue as it blends in more. Not required, but the stock ones can fail after some time.

##### Replacements: 
- I got the leadscrew bent during a transport, the replacement one is a _400mm height 8mm T8 leadscrew_, with a new nut as the stock one isn't fully compatible. They can be bought for 2-4$ on AliExpress. It doesn't require any software changes, but may be a bit time-consuming to replace for the first time.
- The stock fans on the nozzle are the 4010 24V turbine fan, and the 40x40x10mm 24V fan. The chinese replacements are a bit quieter than the stock, but I would recommend checking out big brands for replacements.

## Models
Here's a list of all the models I have made to date:
- Pneumatic Push-in Fitting Removal Tool: Made for my highschool as a replacement, it's used for removing 4mm and 6mm pneumatic tubes from push-in fittings. Made in Blender, project files included.

I also have all models uploaded to Thingiverse, under the user [OliverP](https://www.thingiverse.com/oliverp_/designs).
